A limechat theme based on the solarized color scheme: http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized

Put the *.js, *.yaml, and *.css files in ~/Library/Application\ Support/LimeChat/Themes

The dark variation is almost complete, but the light variation still needs work.

Special feature: click the topic bar in a channel to toggle channel events
